Project Name: 
<i>Thriftin’</i> ( A Commercial for Al Yousef Center Abu Dhabi)

Project Description:
The project basically came out from an impromptu trip to the Al Yousef Center thrift shop which is a semi-popular destination in terms of thrift shopping in the UAE. Being a 15 min bus ride away from Saadiyat Island and also providing much more affordable and sustainable form of buying clothes as compared to fast fashion stores in the malls, the concept pretty much boils down to making a commercial for the thrift store. Through this commercial, the aim is to raise awareness in a fun and eclectic way to inspire a connection to this unseen, ignored and previously stigmatised shopping model because of heavy abundance of second-hand material. 

Process:
The filmmaking process was relatively quick as it was mainly down to a documentary shooting style but in a trendy tie-to way to reach out to Gen-Z sensibilities. It was later edited in a way to have an initial narrative where Alejandro, the actor is frustrated with online shopping on Zara’s website and hence dreams of a place that can fulfil his fashion needs. We use this segue to a commercial for the thrift store in an eclectic fashion using music that was being played in the Thrift Store itself bringing out the liveliness of the place.
The coding process was initiated through the decision of choosing a particular visual design that induces such a retro/eclectic vibe in relation to the thrift store I visited. Hence, I went for a vapourware aesthetic very much in line with these vibes and also the underlying anti-capitalist tones it has and which have been used widely in popular culture.
After that, it was mainly just using tools that were available to me to bring out the best possible version of the site in the time we had bearing in mind my limited knowledge of html before going into it. Through multiple viewings of previous year’s student websites via inspecting their pages and often searching up google on how I can implement an idea helped a lot 
For eg.,
An embedded map which shows the store’s location
Carousel for the items available in the store  
Overlays on the cast and crew member’s photos using mouse-enter/leave events in JavaScript.

Reflection/Evaluation:
Overall, it was a very challenging yet rewarding process to be able to print out a design of something I had in my mind on a website. Resources like Google Fonts really helped elevate the aesthetic to one level up and closer to the vapourware aesthetic I was aiming for. I did run into issues of scalability and I dealt with it hiding the overflow of the html element and aim to understand how I can fix that properly as well. Through the use of the aforementioned elements and links to find out more about vintage thrift stores in Abu Dhabi, I feel like we were able to make an interactive, aesthetic and most of all, a website that has information people should be aware of in lieu of the catastrophic rise of fast fashion and the demerits of it.
